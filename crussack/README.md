Purpose:
Boston is home to a number of universities and colleges. I was curious if there was a difference in the cities basic infrustructure, including trtaffic lights, sidewalk, bus stops, and street lights in the areas where the schools are situated. I predicted that there would be better infrastructure surrounding these areas versus the areas of Boston that do not house an academic setting.
